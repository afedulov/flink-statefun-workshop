/**
 * This function tracks the total number of reported fraudulent transactions made against an account
 * on a rolling 30 day period. It supports three three message types:
 *
 * <p>1) {@code ConfirmFraud}: When a customer reports a fraudulent transaction the function will
 * receive this message. It will increment it's internal count and set a 30 day expiration timer.
 *
 * <p>2) {@link ExpireFraud}: After 30 days, the function will receive an expiration message. At
 * this time, it will decrement its internal count.
 *
 * <p>3) {@link QueryFraud}: Any other entity in the system may query the current count by sending
 * this message. The function will reply with the current count wrapped in a {@link ReportedFraud}
 * message.
